With this naive1's upload file we can upload every fill that we want on the
server. We can upload script file to take advantge of the server's permissions.

If we upload the exploit.php on the server we can print the content of
the .passwd file in the uploads dir. We only have to follow the link with the
newly exploit.php uploaded. (e.g localhost/uploads/exploit.php).
